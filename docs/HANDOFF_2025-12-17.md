**From:** Claude (Warp AI Documentation Overhaul)

## What Was Accomplished

### Documentation System Overhaul (Complete)

Transformed the project's documentation from bloated, outdated files into a lean, actionable system designed specifically for AI agent workflows.

**Files Created:**
1. **docs/START.md** — Session entry point (170 lines)
   - Current project health at a glance
   - Known gaps with priorities
   - Recent commit history
   - What works, what needs verification
   - Tech stack snapshot

2. **docs/STUBS.md** — Gap tracking (142 lines)
   - TODOs/FIXMEs categorized by priority
   - Mock data still in production code
   - Missing integrations
   - Legacy components to review

3. **tests/STATUS.md** — Test coverage tracking (185 lines)
   - Test suite status (currently unknown)
   - Test audit checklist
   - Coverage baseline to establish
   - Testing standards and commands

**Files Rewritten:**
4. **warp.md** — Foundation layer (138 lines, was 146)
   - 30-second system health check
   - Mental model of project structure
   - Non-negotiables and truth hierarchy
   - Session workflow
   - Concise, scannable format

5. **AGENTS.md** — AI agent playbook (228 lines, was 280+)
   - Decision framework (ask vs execute)
   - Testing strategy
   - Common patterns (API, components, DB)
   - Error handling
   - "What done means" checklist
   - Communication guidelines
   - Common pitfalls

## Current Project State

### Health Check (as of commit 613299b)
```
TypeScript:  ✅ 0 errors
Tests:       ⚠️  Unknown (needs audit)
Deployment:  ✅ Production live at app.galaxyco.ai
Database:    ✅ Migrations current
```

### Known Issues
1. **Test suite status unknown** — Need to run `npm test -- --run` and document
2. **Coverage not measured** — Need to run `npm run test:coverage` and baseline
3. **100+ TODO/FIXME markers** — Documented in STUBS.md, prioritized
4. **Old docs outdated** — PROJECT_STATUS.md (2000+ lines), FEATURES_MAP.md, MASTER_TASK_LIST.md need deprecation

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Test Infrastructure Audit
Run the test audit checklist from tests/STATUS.md:
```bash
npm test -- --run           # Check test suite
npm run test:coverage       # Get coverage baseline
npx playwright test         # Check E2E status
# Update tests/STATUS.md with results
```

### Priority 2: Address High-Priority Gaps
From STUBS.md:
1. **Stripe Price IDs** — Replace placeholders in pricing/page.tsx
2. **Mock session data** — Replace in settings/page.tsx
3. **avgResponseTime calculation** — Implement in conversations/page.tsx

### Priority 3: Deprecate Old Docs
Consider moving to docs/archive/:
- docs/status/PROJECT_STATUS.md (replaced by START.md)
- docs/FEATURES_MAP.md (outdated)
- docs/MASTER_TASK_LIST.md (outdated)

---

## How to Use the New Documentation System

### At Session Start:
```bash
# 1. Read foundation (30 seconds)
cat warp.md

# 2. Get current state (2 minutes)
cat docs/START.md

# 3. Check for gaps (1 minute)
cat docs/STUBS.md
cat tests/STATUS.md

# 4. Verify baseline
npm run typecheck && npm test
```

### During Work:
- Follow patterns in AGENTS.md
- Execute confidently (80%+ confidence = go)
- Test before presenting
- Update docs as you go

### At Session End:
- Update docs/START.md with current state
- Update docs/STUBS.md if gaps found/fixed
- Update tests/STATUS.md after test runs
- Commit with conventional format
- Push to main

---

## What This Session Did NOT Address

1. **Test suite audit** — Marked as priority but not executed
2. **Coverage baseline** — Needs to be established
3. **Feature work** — No new features, pure documentation
4. **Old doc cleanup** — Marked for deprecation but not deleted

---

## Recommended Focus for Next Session

### Option A: Testing Infrastructure (Recommended)
Establish testing baseline so future work has quality gates:
1. Run test audit checklist
2. Document coverage in tests/STATUS.md
3. Fix any failing tests
4. Set up coverage reporting in CI

### Option B: High-Priority Gap Closure
Pick 2-3 high-priority items from STUBS.md and complete them:
1. Replace Stripe placeholder Price IDs
2. Implement missing data calculations
3. Wire up AI form assistance

### Option C: Feature Deep Dive
User mentioned wanting to "deep dive into key features":
1. Pick a feature area from START.md "What Works"
2. Audit implementation completeness
3. Add missing tests
4. Document findings in STUBS.md

---

## Documentation Philosophy

The new system follows these principles:

1. **Lean over comprehensive** — Only what's needed to start work
2. **Truth over aspiration** — Document current state, not goals
3. **Actionable over descriptive** — What to do, not what was done
4. **Verified over assumed** — Mark unknown status as ⚠️ 
5. **Current over historical** — Update frequently, archive old

---

## Files to Read Next Session

**Must read (in order):**
1. `warp.md` — Foundation (2 min)
2. `docs/START.md` — Current state (3 min)
3. `AGENTS.md` — Reference as needed

**Read when relevant:**
4. `docs/STUBS.md` — Before working on features
5. `tests/STATUS.md` — Before/after test runs
6. `docs/status/AI_CONTEXT.md` — Auto-generated, always current

## Commit Reference

**Commit:** 613299b  
**Message:** "docs: implement new documentation system"  
**Files Changed:** 5 files, +824 insertions, -126 deletions  
**Branch:** main  
**Status:** Pushed to remote

---

## Notes for User

The documentation system is now designed for your workflow:
- ✅ Quick session starts (read START.md first)
- ✅ Clear gap visibility (STUBS.md)
- ✅ Testing clarity (STATUS.md)
- ✅ AI agent guidance (AGENTS.md)
- ✅ Foundation reference (warp.md)

The system expects frequent AI agent turnover due to usage constraints, so each document is self-contained and quick to scan.

**Next AI Agent:** Start by reading `warp.md`, then `docs/START.md`. Good luck! 🚀
