# Session Status — 2025-12-30

Phase: Design System — Phase 2C (Feedback & Overlay Components)
Status: COMPLETE (100%)

## What was built
- Added comprehensive documentation for Context Menu (`docs/design-system/components/navigation/context-menu.md`)
  - 15 subcomponents documented
  - 8 production-ready examples (file, table, image, canvas, checkboxes, text, cards, adaptive)
  - Full accessibility section (keyboard, ARIA, SR support)
  - Mobile/long-press considerations

Along with previously completed in Phase 2C today:
- Alert Dialog, Toast, Popover, Tooltip, Dropdown Menu validated as complete and pushed

## Current project state
- Design System components coverage (major):
  - Inputs: complete for v1
  - Feedback & Overlays: complete for v1 (Phase 2C)
  - Navigation: Tabs, Dropdown Menu, Context Menu documented
  - Containers: Card, Dialog, Popover documented
  - Data: Badge, Table documented

## Next recommended steps
1. Phase 3 (Navigation & Data Display) kickoff
   - Components to add next: Breadcrumbs, Pagination, Progress, Skeleton, Accordion, Hover Card, Menubar, Command Menu
2. Create a Design System index/landing doc that links all components and tokens
3. Cross-link audit: ensure Related Components + Tokens sections resolve and are consistent
4. Accessibility pass: verify keyboard tables and ARIA references across all 7 Phase 2C docs

## Files modified
- Added: `docs/design-system/components/navigation/context-menu.md`
- Updated: `docs/status/AI_CONTEXT.md` (Current Status)

## Known issues / risks
- Link drift risk between component docs and tokens
- Keep parity with Radix UI updates (semantics/props) to avoid a11y drift
- Mobile parity between Dropdown vs Context Menu patterns
