# ENV_AUDIT_REPORT

This is a stub file created to satisfy links from `README.md`.

- The latest, detailed environment configuration and audits are primarily documented in `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and under `docs/`.
- When you next run a full environment review, you can either:
  - Move that content here, or
  - Update `README.md` to point to the canonical doc under `docs/`.

For now, treat `PROJECT_STATUS.md` as the single source of truth for environment health.
