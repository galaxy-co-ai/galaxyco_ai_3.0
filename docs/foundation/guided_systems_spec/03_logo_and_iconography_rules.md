# GalaxyCo — Logo and Iconography Rules

> **Purpose**  
This document defines the correct usage, meaning, and constraints of GalaxyCo’s logo, rocket mark, and iconography system. It ensures visual consistency, preserves symbolic intent, and prevents dilution of the brand as the product scales.

This is not a logo showcase. It is a **usage contract**.

---

## 1. The Role of the Logo

The GalaxyCo logo is not decorative.

It is a **system metaphor**.

It communicates three permanent truths:
1. **One direction** (upward momentum)
2. **One active path** (the plume)
3. **Contained power** (controlled lift, no explosion)

Any usage that breaks these truths is invalid.

---

## 2. Logo Components

### Primary Mark
- Rocket body
- Circular window
- Plume (single, continuous flow)

These components must always appear together in the full logo.

---

### Wordmark
- “GALAXY” text paired with the rocket
- Rocket aligns centrally above the primary ascent axis
- The plume visually intersects the wordmark intentionally

The wordmark is part of the system, not a caption.

---

## 3. Approved Logo Variants

### 3.1 Full Logo (Primary)
**Use when:**
- Marketing pages
- Landing pages
- Brand moments

**Rules:**
- Adequate negative space
- No added effects
- No distortion or perspective tilt

---

### 3.2 Rocket-Only Mark
**Use when:**
- App icon
- Loading states
- Compact UI contexts

**Rules:**
- Rocket remains upright
- Plume remains singular
- No additional motion or decoration

The rocket alone still implies guidance and momentum.

---

### 3.3 App Icon Variant
**Use when:**
- iOS / Android
- Browser favicon

**Rules:**
- Rounded square container
- Rocket centered
- Background remains deep navy
- No text

The icon must feel calm, premium, and unmistakable.

---

## 4. Clear Space & Placement

### Clear Space Rule
- Maintain clear space equal to the rocket window diameter on all sides
- No UI elements may intrude into this space

The logo must never feel crowded.

---

### Alignment Rules
- Prefer vertical centering
- Avoid edge-hugging
- The logo should feel *anchored*, not floating

---

## 5. Color Usage

### Approved Color Pairings
- White rocket on deep navy background
- Dark rocket on light background
- Cyan plume only

---

### Forbidden Color Treatments
- Gradient rocket bodies
- Multicolor plumes
- Neon accents
- Pattern fills

Color changes must never introduce visual noise.

---

## 6. Iconography System

### Icon Style
- Rounded geometry only
- Consistent stroke weight
- Simple, immediately legible forms

Icons should feel **engineered**, not playful.

---

### Icon Usage Rules
- One icon per action
- No decorative icons
- Icons must reinforce meaning, not decorate space

---

## 7. Motion Constraints (If Animated)

### Allowed
- Slow upward drift
- Gentle plume extension
- Subtle easing

---

### Forbidden
- Shaking
- Explosions
- Rapid acceleration
- Looping chaos

Motion must reinforce confidence.

---

## 8. Misuse Examples (Never Allowed)

- Tilting the rocket diagonally
- Splitting the plume into branches
- Adding flames or sparks
- Making the rocket aggressive or playful

The rocket is not a toy.

---

## 9. Relationship to Guided Systems

The logo is the **simplest expression** of the Guided Systems philosophy.

If a UI flow contradicts the logo’s meaning, the UI is wrong.

The logo always wins.

---

## 10. Final Rule

If there is uncertainty:

> **Keep the rocket upright. Keep the path singular. Keep the motion calm.**

That is the GalaxyCo mark.
