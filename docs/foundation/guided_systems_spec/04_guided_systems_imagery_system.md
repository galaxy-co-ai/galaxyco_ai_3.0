# GalaxyCo — Guided Systems Imagery System

> **Purpose**  
This document defines how abstract system imagery is used across GalaxyCo. It ensures all visuals reinforce clarity, calm, and guidance — never spectacle or confusion.

Imagery in GalaxyCo is not decoration. It is **structural communication**.

---

## 1. Role of Imagery in GalaxyCo

System imagery exists to:
- Reduce perceived complexity
- Communicate structure without explanation
- Create emotional reassurance

Imagery must never:
- Show everything at once
- Impress through density
- Compete with UI elements

If an image increases cognitive load, it is incorrect.

---

## 2. Imagery Philosophy

### Guided Systems Visual Principle

Every image must visually answer one question:

> **“What is the system doing for me right now?”**

Images do not explain features. They imply order.

---

## 3. Imagery Types (Canonical)

GalaxyCo recognizes **two** primary imagery types.

---

### 3.1 System Authority Imagery (Primary)

**Purpose:**
- Establish trust
- Communicate stability
- Signal system intelligence

**Characteristics:**
- Clear central gravity
- Fewer, larger nodes
- Strong hierarchy
- Generous negative space

**Emotional Signal:**
> “There is a core intelligence. Everything is under control.”

**Use Cases:**
- Landing page hero sections
- Dashboard overview states
- Empty states
- High-level system moments

This is the default imagery style.

---

### 3.2 System Flow Imagery (Secondary)

**Purpose:**
- Show progression
- Imply next steps
- Visualize movement through the system

**Characteristics:**
- Continuous paths
- Sequenced nodes
- Directional flow
- Slightly increased density (still restrained)

**Emotional Signal:**
> “You are moving forward, step by step.”

**Use Cases:**
- Onboarding flows
- Workflow builders
- Guided setup moments

System Flow imagery must never dominate the screen.

---

## 4. Zoom Levels

### Overview Level
- One primary focal point
- Secondary elements fade
- No detailed labeling

Used when reassurance is more important than instruction.

---

### Operational Level
- Limited number of nodes (5–9 max)
- Clear sequence
- Subtle labels allowed

Used when guiding action, not explaining architecture.

---

## 5. Density Rules (Hard Limits)

- Maximum visible nodes per image: **9**
- Maximum concurrent paths: **3**
- No full meshes
- No tangled intersections

If an image needs a legend to be understood, it is invalid.

---

## 6. Composition Rules

- One dominant path or center
- Secondary paths are visually lighter
- Paths never cross aggressively
- Curves only, no sharp turns

Composition must feel *routed*, not discovered.

---

## 7. Color & Material Alignment

Imagery must strictly follow the Guided Systems palette:
- Deep navy backgrounds
- Slate and muted blue-grays
- Cyan accents used sparingly

Materials:
- Matte ceramic
- Frosted glass
- Satin polymer

No neon. No chrome. No biological texture.

---

## 8. Relationship to UI

Imagery must always defer to UI:
- Lower contrast than primary UI elements
- Softer edges
- Slower perceived motion

Imagery should feel like **context**, not content.

---

## 9. Animation Constraints (If Used)

Allowed:
- Slow drift
- Gentle path illumination
- Subtle parallax

Forbidden:
- Pulsing highlights
- Rapid movement
- Attention-grabbing loops

Motion must never demand attention.

---

## 10. Misuse Examples (Never Allowed)

- Brain imagery
- Dense neural webs
- Sci-fi circuitry
- Overlapping paths
- Decorative glow effects

If it looks impressive but stressful, it is wrong.

---

## 11. Validation Checklist

Before approving imagery, confirm:

- Does it show one clear system intention?
- Is hierarchy immediately obvious?
- Does it reduce anxiety?
- Does it align with the rocket metaphor?

If any answer is “no,” revise.

---

## 12. Final Rule

Imagery should make users think:

> **“This system already understands the complexity — I don’t have to.”**

That is the role of Guided Systems imagery.
