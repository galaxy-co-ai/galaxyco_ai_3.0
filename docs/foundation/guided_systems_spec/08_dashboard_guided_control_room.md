# GalaxyCo — Dashboard: Guided Control Room

> **Purpose**  
This document defines the dashboard as GalaxyCo’s primary control surface. It translates the Guided Systems philosophy into a clear, calm, and confidence-building first experience.

The dashboard is not a feature index. It is a **guided control room**.

---

## 1. Dashboard Philosophy

The dashboard exists to answer one question:

> **“What should I focus on right now?”**

Everything else is secondary.

If the dashboard presents choices without guidance, it has failed.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### One Dominant Focus
- Only **one primary recommendation** may exist at a time
- All other elements must visually recede

### Calm Authority
- No urgency cues
- No competing CTAs
- No dense information blocks

The dashboard should feel composed, not busy.

---

## 3. Dashboard Layout Model

### Vertical Hierarchy (Top → Bottom)

1. **System Orientation**  
   High-level reassurance and context

2. **Primary Guidance Zone**  
   The single most important action or insight

3. **Supporting Context**  
   Secondary information that informs, not distracts

4. **Background System State**  
   Passive awareness of what the system is handling

---

## 4. System Orientation Zone

### Purpose
Provide reassurance and grounding.

### Characteristics
- Minimal text
- Calm visual language
- No actions required

Example intent:
> “Everything is connected and running as expected.”

This zone sets emotional tone.

---

## 5. Primary Guidance Zone (Most Important)

### Purpose
Direct the user toward the **next meaningful step**.

### Rules
- Exactly one primary action
- Presented as a stable card or module
- Clear outcome

### Examples
- “Create your first agent”
- “Review Neptune’s recommendation”
- “Connect your data source”

This zone must never compete with anything else.

---

## 6. Supporting Context Zone

### Purpose
Offer optional information for situational awareness.

### Rules
- Visually quieter than primary guidance
- Limited density
- No required actions

Examples:
- Recent activity
- System summaries
- Background processes

Users should feel free to ignore this zone.

---

## 7. Background System State

### Purpose
Signal that the system is active without interruption.

### Rules
- Passive indicators only
- No alerts unless critical
- No calls to action

This reinforces trust without demanding attention.

---

## 8. Role of Neptune on the Dashboard

Neptune is present but not dominant.

### Neptune’s Behavior
- Appears contextually
- Speaks sparingly
- Suggests, never commands

Neptune should feel like a calm operator in the room.

---

## 9. Empty & First-Time Dashboard States

### First-Time Users
- One welcoming guidance card
- Clear first action
- No secondary distractions

### Returning Users (No Immediate Action)
- Reassurance state
- Optional exploration

Empty does not mean inactive.

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns (Never Allowed)

- Feature grids
- Button walls
- Multiple highlighted actions
- Metric overload
- “Choose what to do” dashboards

Choice without guidance is abandonment.

---

## 11. Validation Checklist

Before approving dashboard changes, confirm:

- Is there one dominant focus?
- Is the next step obvious?
- Does the dashboard feel calm?
- Would a new user feel reassured?

If not, remove elements.

---

## 12. Final North Star

The dashboard should always feel like:

> **“I’m oriented, supported, and already moving forward.”**

That is the purpose of the Guided Control Room.
