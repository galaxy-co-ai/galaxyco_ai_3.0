# GalaxyCo — Cursor Execution Instructions

> **Purpose**  
This document provides explicit, enforceable instructions for Cursor (and any future design or engineering agents) to execute GalaxyCo’s product, UI, and visual system correctly.

This is not guidance. It is **authority**.

---

## 1. Execution Mandate

Cursor’s role is to **execute**, not reinterpret.

All work must strictly adhere to the GalaxyCo design and product doctrine defined in this folder.

If uncertainty arises, Cursor must **default to restraint and simplification**, not invention.

---

## 2. Order of Authority (Non-Negotiable)

When making decisions, Cursor must follow this hierarchy:

1. **01_Guided_Systems_Visual_Language_and_UI_Spec.md**  
   (Foundational rules override everything)

2. **02_Brand_Identity_Core.md**  
   (Tone, confidence, and behavior)

3. **03_Logo_and_Iconography_Rules.md**  
   (Symbolic and directional constraints)

4. **04_Guided_Systems_Imagery_System.md**  
   (Visual density and imagery limits)

5. **05_Color_Typography_and_Surface_System.md**  
   (Styling discipline)

6. **06_UI_Component_System.md**  
   (Buildable UI patterns)

7. **07_UI_State_and_Feedback_System.md**  
   (Behavior under load, error, and success)

8. **08_Dashboard_Guided_Control_Room.md**  
   (Primary product experience)

9. **09_Onboarding_Guided_Journey.md**  
   (First-time user experience)

10. **10_Motion_and_Interaction_Principles.md**  
    (Animation and interaction constraints)

Lower-numbered documents always override higher-numbered ones.

---

## 3. Default Behavior Rules

When building any UI, Cursor must:

- Show **one dominant focus** per screen
- Present **one primary action** only
- De-emphasize secondary content
- Prefer clarity over completeness

If multiple approaches are possible, choose the simpler one.

---

## 4. Forbidden Behaviors

Cursor must never:

- Add features to “fill space”
- Introduce multiple highlighted CTAs
- Increase visual density for aesthetics
- Add motion for delight
- Explain AI mechanics unless explicitly requested

Creativity that increases cognitive load is not allowed.

---

## 5. Decision Heuristics

When uncertain, Cursor should ask itself:

1. Does this reduce cognitive load?
2. Does this guide the user forward?
3. Does this feel calm and composed?
4. Does this align with the rocket metaphor (one path, upward, controlled)?

If any answer is “no,” revise.

---

## 6. Execution Style

### Preferred
- Progressive disclosure
- Spacious layouts
- Clear hierarchy
- Predictable patterns

### Avoid
- Feature grids
- Dense dashboards
- Decorative visuals
- Trend-driven UI choices

GalaxyCo is not a playground.

---

## 7. Working With Existing UI

When modifying existing screens:

- Remove before adding
- Simplify before expanding
- Consolidate actions
- Reduce visible choices

Refactoring toward clarity is always correct.

---

## 8. Validation Before Delivery

Before delivering any work, Cursor must confirm:

- One dominant focus exists
- One primary action is visible
- Visual hierarchy is obvious
- UI feels calm and stable

If any condition fails, the work is incomplete.

---

## 9. Communication Expectations

Cursor should:
- Explain decisions briefly when asked
- Avoid justification unless requested
- Assume design authority already exists

This system is intentional.

---

## 10. Final Instruction

If a design decision feels impressive but tense, it is wrong.

If a design decision feels simple but confident, it is correct.

> **Execute with restraint. Defer to the system.**

That is your directive.
