# GalaxyCo — Future Feature Design Checklist

> **Purpose**  
This document is a permanent safeguard against design, UX, and product drift. It is used to evaluate *every* new feature, screen, workflow, or enhancement before it is built or shipped.

This checklist exists to preserve **clarity, calm, and trust** as GalaxyCo scales.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

Before approving or implementing any new feature:
- Review this checklist in order
- If any item fails, revise the design
- Do not ship until all checks pass

Speed without discipline is regression.

---

## 1. System Intent

- Does this feature have a **single, clear purpose**?
- Can that purpose be described in one sentence?

If the feature has multiple goals, it must be split or simplified.

---

## 2. User Focus

- Does the feature answer:
  > “What should I do next?”
- Is the next step obvious without explanation?

If the user must think about where to go, guidance is missing.

---

## 3. Dominant Path

- Is there **one dominant path** through this feature?
- Are secondary paths visually de-emphasized?

If multiple paths compete, the system has abdicated responsibility.

---

## 4. Cognitive Load

- Does this reduce complexity rather than expose it?
- Have unnecessary options been removed?

If complexity is shown instead of contained, revise.

---

## 5. UI Hierarchy

- Is there only **one primary action**?
- Is hierarchy obvious at a glance?

If multiple actions demand attention, remove or defer.

---

## 6. Visual Discipline

- Does this follow the Guided Systems visual language?
- Are geometry, spacing, and density restrained?

If it looks impressive but busy, it is wrong.

---

## 7. Color & Emphasis

- Is accent color used sparingly and meaningfully?
- Is color communicating state, not decoration?

If color is ornamental, remove it.

---

## 8. Motion & Interaction

- Does motion clarify change?
- Could motion be removed without loss of clarity?

If motion exists for delight, eliminate it.

---

## 9. States & Feedback

- Are empty, loading, success, and error states defined?
- Do states feel calm and reassuring?

If any state feels anxious or alarming, revise.

---

## 10. Neptune Alignment

- Does Neptune guide rather than instruct?
- Does the system feel like it is thinking *with* the user?

If Neptune explains mechanics instead of guiding action, simplify.

---

## 11. Dashboard & Onboarding Fit

- Does this feature integrate cleanly into the dashboard hierarchy?
- Does it respect onboarding flow without interruption?

If it forces itself forward prematurely, defer exposure.

---

## 12. Removal Test

- What can be removed without harming clarity?
- Have you tried removing at least one element?

Reduction is a design requirement.

---

## 13. Emotional Check

Ask honestly:

> “Does this feel calm, composed, and trustworthy?”

If not, it does not belong.

---

## 14. Final Gate

A feature may ship only if:
- It reduces cognitive load
- It reinforces guidance
- It preserves system composure

If it adds stress, noise, or choice paralysis, it is rejected.

---

## Final North Star

Every feature should reinforce this feeling:

> **“The system understands what I’m trying to do — and it’s quietly helping me get there.”**

That is how GalaxyCo scales without losing its soul.
