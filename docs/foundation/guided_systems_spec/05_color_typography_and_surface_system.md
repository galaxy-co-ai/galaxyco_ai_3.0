# GalaxyCo — Color, Typography, and Surface System

> **Purpose**  
This document defines how color, typography, and surfaces work together to create GalaxyCo’s calm, premium, and trustworthy interface. These rules prevent visual noise, inconsistency, and aesthetic drift as the product scales.

This is not a style guide for taste. It is a **system for restraint**.

---

## 1. Visual Intent

GalaxyCo’s UI should feel:
- Composed
- Premium
- Quietly confident

Nothing should feel loud, urgent, or decorative.

If a visual choice draws attention to itself instead of the task, it is wrong.

---

## 2. Color Philosophy

Color in GalaxyCo communicates **meaning**, not personality.

Color exists to:
- Indicate state
- Guide attention
- Reinforce hierarchy

Color must never be used for excitement or novelty.

---

## 3. Core Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Deep Navy / Midnight Blue**  
  Used for primary backgrounds, containers, and brand anchoring.

- **Slate / Muted Blue-Gray**  
  Used for secondary surfaces, dividers, and subtle contrast.

### Accent Color
- **Soft Cyan / Aqua**  
  Used sparingly to indicate:
  - Active elements
  - Next steps
  - Successful states

Accent color is a signal, not decoration.

---

## 4. Color Usage Rules

### Allowed
- One accent color per screen
- Accent color applied to the most important element only
- Muted tonal variations for depth

### Forbidden
- Multiple accent colors competing
- Neon or high-saturation colors
- Rainbow palettes
- Gradient abuse

If color competes for attention, it violates Guided Systems.

---

## 5. Background & Surface Layers

### Surface Hierarchy
1. **Base Background** – deep navy
2. **Primary Surface** – slate or softened navy
3. **Secondary Surface** – lighter muted tone
4. **Interactive Element** – subtle elevation

Each layer should be visually distinct but emotionally quiet.

---

### Surface Rules
- Prefer flat surfaces with soft depth
- Shadows must be subtle and diffuse
- No harsh contrast edges

Surfaces should feel *manufactured*, not digital.

---

## 6. Typography Philosophy

Typography in GalaxyCo is functional clarity.

It must:
- Reduce reading effort
- Establish hierarchy instantly
- Never call attention to itself

Typography should feel like **infrastructure**.

---

## 7. Typographic Hierarchy

### Headings
- Confident, calm, and concise
- Used sparingly
- No exaggerated weights

### Body Text
- Neutral
- Highly readable
- Short line lengths preferred

### Supporting Text
- Muted color
- Secondary importance
- Never compete with primary content

---

## 8. Typography Rules

- No playful fonts
- No excessive letter spacing
- No decorative typefaces
- No novelty typography

If a font feels expressive, it is wrong.

---

## 9. Contrast & Accessibility

- Maintain sufficient contrast without harshness
- Avoid pure white on pure black
- Prefer softened whites and off-blacks

Accessibility should feel *considered*, not bolted on.

---

## 10. Micro-Interactions & Emphasis

### Emphasis Rules
- Use weight before color
- Use spacing before weight
- Use color last

Hierarchy should be achieved through structure, not saturation.

---

## 11. Relationship to Guided Systems

Color, typography, and surfaces must always support:
- One dominant path
- One primary action
- One moment of focus

Anything that fragments attention is incorrect.

---

## 12. Validation Checklist

Before approving UI styling, confirm:

- Does color communicate meaning?
- Is typography effortless to read?
- Do surfaces feel calm and intentional?
- Is attention guided without force?

If not, simplify.

---

## 13. Final Rule

GalaxyCo’s interface should feel like:

> **“Nothing here is accidental — and nothing is trying too hard.”**

That is the mark of a mature system.
