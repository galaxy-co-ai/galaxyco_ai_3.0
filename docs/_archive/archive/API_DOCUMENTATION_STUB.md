# API_DOCUMENTATION

This stub exists because `README.md` links to `./API_DOCUMENTATION.md` as the main API reference.

Currently, detailed endpoint descriptions are spread across:
- Route implementations under `src/app/api/**`
- Inline comments and Zod schemas
- Phase and feature docs under `docs/`

Suggested future use for this file:
- High-level index of major API groups (assistant, CRM, marketing, orchestration, analytics, content cockpit, etc.)
- Pointers into route files or generated OpenAPI/typed clients.

Until then, treat `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and the route files themselves as the source of truth.
