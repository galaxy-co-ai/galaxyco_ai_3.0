## 3) The 3 biggest problems we solve

1. **CRMs are overkill and rarely kept up to date**  
   - What it looks like day-to-day: Notes in notebooks, follow-ups in email, pipelines forgotten.
   - Cost of doing nothing: Missed renewals, weak relationships, and lost referrals.

2. **Client knowledge is scattered and not reusable**  
   - What it looks like day-to-day: Re-explaining context every engagement, hunting for past docs.
   - Cost of doing nothing: Slower delivery and less leverage from prior work.

3. **Admin work steals time from billable work**  
   - What it looks like day-to-day: Writing proposals, scheduling calls, sending reminders manually.
   - Cost of doing nothing: Lower effective hourly rate and burnout.
