# Sales Teams & SDRs — GalaxyCo.ai Use Case

## 1) One-line outcome
**GalaxyCo helps sales teams and SDRs close more deals by automatically qualifying leads, prioritizing pipeline, and handling outreach busywork — so reps spend time selling, not updating tools.**

---

## 2) Who this is for
- **Best fit:** Small to mid-sized B2B sales teams, SDR teams, and founder-led sales motions.
- **Also fits:** Solo AEs, early-stage startups without a dedicated RevOps function.
- **Not ideal if:** You run a large enterprise sales org with heavily customized legacy tooling.

---

## 3) The 3 biggest problems we solve

1. **Leads aren’t prioritized correctly**  
   - What it looks like day-to-day: Reps guessing who to contact first, treating all leads equally.
   - Cost of doing nothing: Low conversion rates and wasted effort.

2. **Pipeline visibility is unreliable**  
   - What it looks like day-to-day: Outdated CRM data, inaccurate forecasts, surprise misses.
   - Cost of doing nothing: Poor planning and missed revenue targets.

3. **Outreach is repetitive and time-consuming**  
   - What it looks like day-to-day: Manually writing emails, LinkedIn messages, and follow-ups.
   - Cost of doing nothing: Fewer touches and slower deal cycles.
