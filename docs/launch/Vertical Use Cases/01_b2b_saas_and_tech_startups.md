# B2B SaaS / Tech Startups — GalaxyCo.ai Use Case

## 1) One-line outcome
**GalaxyCo helps B2B SaaS teams generate, qualify, and close more revenue by automating RevOps and GTM workflows with AI — without hiring more SDRs or stitching together five tools.**

---

## 2) Who this is for
- **Best fit:** Seed to Series B B2B SaaS startups with a small sales, marketing, or founder-led GTM team.
- **Also fits:** Technical founders doing their own outbound, early RevOps hires, lean growth teams.
- **Not ideal if:** You already run a fully staffed enterprise RevOps org with heavy Salesforce customization.

---

## 3) The 3 biggest problems we solve

1. **Revenue operations are fragmented across too many tools**  
   - What it looks like day-to-day: CRM in one place, outreach in another, notes in Notion, follow-ups in Slack, and no single source of truth.
   - Cost of doing nothing: Missed leads, poor attribution, slow decision-making, and tool fatigue.

2. **Leads don’t get followed up fast or consistently enough**  
   - What it looks like day-to-day: Inbound leads sit untouched, outbound follow-ups slip, and reps work off memory instead of systems.
   - Cost of doing nothing: Lower conversion rates, lost pipeline, and wasted marketing spend.

3. **Scaling outbound requires hiring SDRs too early**  
   - What it looks like day-to-day: Founders or AEs manually prospecting, writing repetitive emails, and updating CRM instead of closing.
   - Cost of doing nothing: Burnout, slow growth, and premature headcount costs.

### Problem #1 → Fragmented RevOps

### Problem #2 → Slow or inconsistent follow-up

### Problem #3 → Needing more SDRs to scale
- **What GalaxyCo does:** Automates repetitive GTM tasks traditionally handled by SDRs.
- **How it works in plain English:** AI agents research, qualify, draft outreach, and keep CRM updated so humans focus on closing.
- **Result you get:** Scale outbound motion without scaling headcount.
