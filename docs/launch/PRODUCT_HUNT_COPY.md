### Long Description

#### Problem
Most businesses juggle 5-10 different tools to run operations: separate CRM, marketing automation, document management, task tracking, and communication tools. This creates:
- Context switching that kills productivity
- Data scattered across platforms
- Manual busywork that AI should handle
- Tool fatigue and subscription overload

#### Solution
GalaxyCo is an AI-native business operations platform that unifies everything you need into one seamless workspace:

**🎯 AI Agents That Actually Work**
- Not just chatbots — agents that take action on your behalf
- Research leads, qualify prospects, draft content, and manage follow-ups
- Neptune AI orchestrator coordinates all agents and surfaces priorities

**💼 Intelligent CRM**
- Auto-score leads with AI
- Automatic pipeline updates as work happens
- Deal context captured without manual entry

**🚀 Workflow Automation**
- Visual workflow builder (no code required)
- Connect tools and trigger actions automatically
- Pre-built templates for common business processes

**📚 Knowledge Management**
- Semantic search across all your documents
- AI-powered document generation and summaries
- Client workspaces with secure access controls

**📊 Unified Marketing Hub**
- Campaign planning and execution
- Content calendar with AI-assisted creation
- Analytics and reporting in one place

#### What Makes It Different
- **AI-Native from Day One:** Not legacy software with AI bolted on
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** AI assists and automates, but you stay in control
- **Built for Speed:** Modern tech stack, fast performance, no bloat
- **One Platform:** Replace HubSpot + Notion + Zapier + Monday.com

#### Public Beta Offer
✨ **Free until January 2026**
- Full platform access
- All features unlocked
- No credit card required
- Help shape the product roadmap

## Maker Comment (First Comment on Launch)

**Post immediately after going live:**

```
Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Dalton, and I built GalaxyCo because I was tired of juggling 10 different tools to run my business.

GalaxyCo is an AI-native business platform that combines:
• CRM with AI lead scoring
• Knowledge base with semantic search
• Marketing campaign management
• AI agents that actually do work (not just chat)
• All orchestrated by Neptune, your AI business assistant

What makes it different:
✅ One platform instead of 10 tools
✅ AI that takes action, not just answers questions
✅ Built for how you actually work, not enterprise workflows
✅ Modern, fast, and actually pleasant to use

We're in public beta and it's FREE until January 2026. No credit card, no catches — just building with early users to make this the best it can be.

I'd love your feedback! What business operations eat up most of your time?

Try it: https://www.galaxyco.ai

Happy to answer any questions!

- Dalton
