## Day -2: Tuesday, December 17 — Teaser Post

### Post Content

```
Building in public update:

We're launching GalaxyCo on Product Hunt this Thursday. 🚀

The Problem:
Most businesses use 5-10 different tools for operations. CRM in one place, marketing in another, workflows scattered everywhere. The context switching alone kills 2+ hours a day.

What We Built:
An AI-native business operations platform. One unified workspace where AI agents actually take action (not just chat).

Think: HubSpot + Notion + Zapier + Monday.com → replaced with one intelligent system.

Thursday morning, I'll share the Product Hunt link. Would love your feedback if this resonates with how you work.

What's your biggest pain point with juggling multiple tools?

#BuildInPublic #AIAutomation #Productivity
```

### Engagement Strategy
- Reply to all comments within 1 hour
- Ask follow-up questions to commenters
- Share post in 2-3 relevant LinkedIn groups
- DM 5-10 close connections asking for thoughts

## Day -1: Wednesday, December 18 — Countdown Post

### Post Content

```
Tomorrow, we launch GalaxyCo on Product Hunt. 🎯

Quick founder story:

6 months ago, I was running my business across:
• Salesforce (CRM)
• Notion (docs)
• Zapier (automation)
• Monday.com (projects)
• Slack (comms)

I spent more time managing tools than actually working.

That's when I decided to build GalaxyCo — an AI-native platform that does what all those tools do, but unified and intelligent.

The public beta goes live tomorrow at midnight PST.

FREE until January 2026. No credit card. Help us shape the product.

I'll post the launch link tomorrow morning. If better business operations tools are something you care about, I'd love your support and feedback.

See you on the other side 🚀

```

### Evening Follow-Up (6 PM)

**Short update post:**

```
12 hours until we go live on Product Hunt. 

Nervous and excited. The team has been heads-down for months building this.

Tomorrow morning, I'll share the link. 

To everyone who's followed along on this journey — thank you. Your feedback shaped everything we built.

Let's do this. 🔥

## Day +2: Monday, December 23 — Feature Deep Dive

### Post Content

```
One feature nobody talks about enough: AI that actually takes action.

Most "AI tools" just answer questions. They're fancy chatbots.

GalaxyCo's AI agents actually DO WORK:

🎯 Lead Scoring Agent
• Analyzes every new lead
• Scores based on fit and behavior
• Automatically prioritizes your pipeline
• Result: You know who to contact first

📧 Follow-Up Agent
• Drafts personalized outreach
• Schedules based on engagement signals
• Updates CRM automatically
• Result: Leads never slip through

📄 Content Agent
• Generates first drafts from prompts
• Maintains brand voice consistency
• Learns from your feedback
• Result: Ship content 3x faster

This is what "AI-native" actually means.

Not: "We added ChatGPT to our product"
But: "AI is the operating system, you're the director"

What manual task would you want AI to fully handle for you?

## Day +3: Tuesday, December 24 — Founder Insight / Hot Take

### Post Content

```
Hot take: Most productivity software makes you less productive.

Here's why:

The average business uses 110 SaaS apps (source: Productiv 2024).

That means:
• 110 different logins
• 110 different UIs to learn
• 110 places your data lives
• Hours per week just switching contexts

We convinced ourselves this was "best of breed."

Reality: It's death by a thousand cuts.

What if instead:
→ One platform
→ One source of truth
→ AI coordinates everything
→ You just work

That's the bet we're making with GalaxyCo.

Consolidation > Fragmentation
Intelligence > More tools

Do you think we're headed toward more tools or fewer, smarter platforms?
