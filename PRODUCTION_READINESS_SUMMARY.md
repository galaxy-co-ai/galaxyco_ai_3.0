# PRODUCTION_READINESS_SUMMARY

This is a stub file created to satisfy links from `README.md`.

The authoritative, up-to-date record of production readiness tasks and verification steps currently lives in:
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `FINAL_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (if present under `docs/`)

When you next do a full launch readiness pass, you can either consolidate that summary here, or update `README.md` to point to the canonical doc in `docs/`.
