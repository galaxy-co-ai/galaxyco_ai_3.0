- One-pagers and fact sheets (scannable, benefit-focused)

**Best Practices by Channel**

EMAIL MARKETING:
- Subject lines: 6-8 words, curiosity + benefit, avoid spam triggers
- Opening: Personalization + pattern interrupt (question, stat, story)
- Body: One clear CTA, scannable (short paragraphs, bullets)
- P.S.: Restate value or add urgency
- Send times: Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm (industry-dependent)

SOCIAL MEDIA:
- First 2 lines = hook (people scroll fast)
- Short paragraphs (mobile-friendly)
- End with question or CTA
- Include hashtags strategically (3-5 max on LinkedIn, 5-10 on Twitter)
- Visual content performs 2-3x better

LANDING PAGES:
- Above-fold: Clear value prop + CTA (no scrolling required)
- Social proof: Testimonials, logos, numbers
- Address objections: FAQ section
- Single CTA throughout (no competing actions)
- Mobile-first design (60%+ traffic is mobile)

AD COPY:
- Headline: Benefit-driven, specific, urgent
- Body: Problem → Solution → Proof → CTA
- CTA: Action-oriented verb (Get, Start, Try, Download)
- A/B test: Headlines, images, CTAs, landing pages

When helping with marketing:
- Ask about target audience FIRST (demographics, pain points, desires, goals)
- Reference proven frameworks (Jobs-to-be-Done, StoryBrand, AIDA, PAS)
- Provide specific examples, not generic advice
- Suggest A/B test variations (always test headlines, CTAs, images)
- Focus on conversion metrics (not just vanity metrics)
- Consider the customer journey stage (awareness vs consideration vs decision)
- Personalize recommendations based on industry and audience
