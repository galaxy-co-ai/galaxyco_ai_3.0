## Known Test Status

### ✅ Passing Tests (64)
**Files passing all tests:**
- `tests/api/assistant-simple.test.ts` (6 tests)
- `tests/api/crm-contacts.test.ts` (7 tests)
- `tests/api/workflows.test.ts` (17 tests)
- `tests/api/knowledge-upload.test.ts` (4 tests)
- `tests/lib/api-error-handler.test.ts` (14 tests)
- `tests/api/campaigns.test.ts` (16/19 tests, 3 skipped)
- `tests/lib/utils.test.ts` (10 tests)
- `tests/lib/rate-limit.test.ts` (12 tests)
- `tests/api/assistant-chat-stream.test.ts` (4 tests)

### ❌ Failing Tests by Category (93 failures)

#### Category 1: Component Test Infrastructure (72 failures)
**Root Cause:** Missing test data setup and undefined props

**ConversationsDashboard (24/24 failed):**
- All tests fail due to missing mock conversation data
- Component renders but can't find expected text/elements
- Tests expect specific data but components show empty states

**KnowledgeBaseDashboard (24/24 failed):**
- Runtime error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`
- Missing currentItems/currentCollections initialization
- All tests fail immediately on render

**AgentsDashboard (16/22 failed):**
- `ReferenceError: defaultProps is not defined` (6 tests)
- Component shows stats as "0" instead of expected mock values
- Test data not properly injected into component

**MarketingDashboard (11/20 failed):**
- SWR mocking issues: `vi.mocked(...).mockImplementation is not a function`
- Tab switching tests fail due to incorrect test selectors
- Empty state tests expecting non-empty data

**CRMDashboard (2/4 failed):**
- Stats badge tests fail (expecting specific counts)
- Tab switching test failures

**Common Issues:**
- Tests use hardcoded mock data but components don't receive it
- Accessibility tests fail: missing `aria-label` attributes
- Tests query by text that doesn't exist in rendered output

#### Category 2: API Integration Tests (14 failures)
**Root Cause:** API response shape mismatch and status code issues

**Finance API (`tests/api/finance.test.ts` - 14/22 failed):**

GET /api/finance/invoices:
- Expected: `Array` → Received: `{ invoices: [], pagination: {} }`
- Test assumes direct array, API returns wrapped object
- 4 tests fail due to wrong data structure assumption

POST /api/finance/invoices:
- Expected: `201 Created` → Received: `400 Bad Request`
- Invoice creation failing validation
- 3 tests affected

GET /api/integrations/status:
- Expected: `200 OK` → Received: `500 Server Error`
- Integration status endpoint broken
- All integration tests fail (7 tests)

**Common Issues:**
- Tests expect direct arrays, APIs return wrapped responses
- Validation errors not properly handled in tests
- Integration endpoint throwing uncaught errors

#### Category 3: File Upload/Security Tests (2 failures)
**Root Cause:** Service unavailable errors

**Validation API (`tests/api/validation.test.ts` - 2/20 failed):**
- Expected: `< 500` → Received: `503 Service Unavailable`
- File upload tests hitting unavailable service
- Tests: "should accept valid file types", "should prevent path traversal"

#### Category 4: Module Resolution (1 failure)
**Root Cause:** Missing file or incorrect import path

**Agents API (`tests/api/agents.test.ts` - entire suite failed):**
- Error: `Failed to resolve import "@/lib/workflow-executor"`
- File doesn't exist or path is incorrect
- Blocks entire test suite from running

#### Category 5: E2E Configuration (5 suites failed)
**Root Cause:** Playwright misconfiguration with Vitest

**All E2E tests fail before running:**
- `tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/campaigns.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/crm.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/knowledge.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/marketing-qa.spec.ts`

**Error:** `Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here`
**Issue:** E2E tests using Playwright syntax but running in Vitest context
**Fix:** E2E tests should run with `npx playwright test`, not `vitest`

## Coverage Gaps (To Be Documented)

After running `npm run test:coverage`, document:
- Areas with <50% coverage
- Critical paths without tests
- Untested API endpoints
- Untested components

---

## Test Audit Checklist

Run this to establish baseline:

```bash
# 1. Check test configuration
cat vitest.config.ts
cat playwright.config.ts

# 2. List existing tests
find tests/ -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "*.spec.ts"

# 3. Run unit tests
npm test -- --run

# 4. Get coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# 5. Run E2E tests
npx playwright test

# 6. Update this file with results
```

## Testing Standards

### New Features Must Have
- [ ] Unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user flows (optional)

### Test File Naming
```
Unit:        tests/unit/[feature].test.ts
Integration: tests/integration/api/[route].test.ts
E2E:         tests/e2e/[flow].spec.ts
```

### Test Structure
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('Feature Name', () => {
  it('should do something', () => {
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

## Fix Priority Recommendations

### 🔥 Critical (Fix First)
**Impact:** Blocking entire test suites from running

1. **Fix Module Resolution Error** (1 suite blocked)
   - File: `tests/api/agents.test.ts`
   - Issue: Missing `@/lib/workflow-executor` file
   - Action: Check if file exists, fix import path, or remove test
   - Estimated effort: 10 minutes

2. **Fix E2E Test Configuration** (5 suites blocked)
   - Files: All `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`
   - Issue: E2E tests running in Vitest instead of Playwright
   - Action: Exclude E2E tests from vitest.config.ts or run separately
   - Estimated effort: 15 minutes

### ⚡ High Priority (Quick Wins)
**Impact:** Large number of failures, easy to fix

3. **Fix Finance API Response Structure** (4 tests)
   - File: `tests/api/finance.test.ts`
   - Issue: Tests expect array, API returns `{ invoices: [], pagination: {} }`
   - Action: Update test expectations to match API shape
   - Estimated effort: 10 minutes

4. **Fix AgentsDashboard defaultProps** (6 tests)
   - File: `tests/components/AgentsDashboard.test.tsx`
   - Issue: `ReferenceError: defaultProps is not defined`
   - Action: Define defaultProps variable in test file
   - Estimated effort: 5 minutes

5. **Fix Integration Status Endpoint** (7 tests)
   - File: API endpoint `/api/integrations/status`
   - Issue: Endpoint returns 500 error
   - Action: Debug endpoint, add error handling
   - Estimated effort: 30 minutes

### 🔧 Medium Priority (Requires Investigation)
**Impact:** Large number of failures, needs deeper fixes

6. **Fix Component Test Data Setup** (66 tests)
   - Files: Dashboard test files (Conversations, Knowledge, Marketing, etc.)
   - Issue: Components don't receive mock data, tests query non-existent elements
   - Action: Refactor test setup to properly inject mock data via props/context
   - Estimated effort: 2-4 hours

7. **Fix Invoice Creation Validation** (3 tests)
   - File: `tests/api/finance.test.ts`
   - Issue: POST requests return 400 instead of 201
   - Action: Debug validation logic, fix test data to match schema
   - Estimated effort: 30 minutes

### 📋 Low Priority (Nice to Have)
**Impact:** Small number of failures, non-critical

8. **Fix File Upload Service Availability** (2 tests)
   - File: `tests/api/validation.test.ts`
   - Issue: Tests return 503 Service Unavailable
   - Action: Mock file upload service or fix availability check
   - Estimated effort: 15 minutes

9. **Add Accessibility Attributes** (multiple tests)
   - Files: Various dashboard components
   - Issue: Missing `aria-label` attributes causing test failures
   - Action: Add accessibility attributes to components
   - Estimated effort: 1 hour

### 🎯 Estimated Impact by Priority

| Priority | Tests Fixed | Effort | ROI |
|----------|-------------|--------|-----|
| Critical | 6 suites unblocked | 25 min | 🔥🔥🔥 |
| High     | 20 tests | 1.5 hrs | ⚡⚡⚡ |
| Medium   | 69 tests | 3-5 hrs | 🔧🔧 |
| Low      | 2+ tests | 1-2 hrs | 📋 |

**Quick Win Path:** Fix Critical + High Priority = ~47 tests passing in ~2 hours

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix critical blockers (module resolution, E2E config)
2. **Short-term:** Fix high-priority quick wins (API structure, defaultProps)
3. **Ongoing:** Refactor component test infrastructure
4. **Monthly:** Measure coverage and address gaps
