# SITE_ASSESSMENT

This is a placeholder created to satisfy the `README.md` link.

Recent, detailed assessments of the live site and application are captured in:
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `docs/audits/` (if present)

You can gradually move structured assessments here (performance, accessibility, UX, error logs) and keep `PROJECT_STATUS.md` focused on timeline and build state.
