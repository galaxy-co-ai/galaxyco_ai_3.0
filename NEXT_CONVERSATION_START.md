I have a fully implemented backend with AI features, CRM CRUD, knowledge base, workflows, and more. 

Summary:
- 25+ API endpoints (documented in API_DOCUMENTATION.md)
- AI Assistant Chat with GPT-4 ✅
- Knowledge Base upload + semantic search ✅
- CRM full CRUD + AI insights ✅
- Workflow execution engine ✅
- Redis caching + rate limiting ✅
- Background jobs configured ✅
- Marketing page complete ✅
- OAuth wiring ready ✅

See HANDOFF_REPORT.md for each page's status.

I want to start with the Dashboard page. I need to:
1. Connect AI Assistant input to POST /api/assistant/chat
2. Fetch real stats from GET /api/dashboard
3. Show agents from GET /api/agents
4. Add loading states
5. Handle errors with toasts

File: src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx

Can you help implement this?
```
