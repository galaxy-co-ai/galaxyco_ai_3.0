# Canonical Design System Declaration

## Status: Authoritative

As of **2025-01-XX**, the **GalaxyCo Guided Systems Design Framework** (Documents **01–13**) is the **single source of truth** for:

- Visual language
- UI structure and behavior
- Component usage
- Motion and interaction principles
- Anchor-based layout decisions

---

## Superseded Documents

The following documents are considered **legacy references** and are no longer authoritative unless explicitly referenced:

- `BRAND_GUIDELINES.md`
- `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`
- Any prior UI or styling documentation created before Guided Systems

These documents may be consulted for historical context only.

---

## Enforcement

All contributors, agents, and tools (including Warp and Cursor) must:

- Defer to Guided Systems documents **01–13**
- Follow the **Cursor Screen Execution Contract** as binding law
- Resolve ambiguity by **simplification**, not invention

Failure to comply constitutes a system violation.
