# GalaxyCo — Guided Systems Visual Language & UI Specification

> **Purpose**  
This document defines GalaxyCo’s unified visual language, UI system, and product philosophy under the **Guided Systems** framework. It is the single source of truth for design, UI, motion, and visual storytelling across the GalaxyCo platform, including Neptune (AI Assistant).

This spec is designed to be handed directly to Cursor (or any design/dev agent) and enforced as a non-negotiable standard.

---

## 1. Core Brand Philosophy

### Guiding Principle
**GalaxyCo does not display intelligence — it contains it.**

Neptune’s role is to make complexity feel already solved. The UI must never dramatize power, speed, or scale. Instead, it communicates:
- Calm authority
- Guided momentum
- Quiet confidence

If a design choice increases excitement but reduces clarity, it is rejected.

---

## 2. Visual Language Name

### **Guided Systems**

A design system built around intentional flow, composure, and controlled progress.

**Guided Systems means:**
- One clear direction at a time
- Visible structure without overwhelm
- Motion and hierarchy that reduce cognitive load

This term should be used internally as a litmus test:
> “Does this align with Guided Systems?”

---

## 3. Geometry & Form Rules (Non‑Negotiable)

### Allowed Geometry
- Circles (primary)
- Soft rounded rectangles
- Gentle arcs
- Even stroke widths

### Forbidden Geometry
- Sharp angles
- Zig‑zag paths
- Dense branching
- Chaotic intersections

**Rule:** If a connection looks discovered instead of routed, it violates the system.

---

## 4. Flow & Hierarchy Rules

### System Flow
- Always show **one dominant path**
- Secondary paths must be visually de‑emphasized
- Peripheral elements fade softly into the background

### Cognitive Rule
The user’s eye should never ask:
> “Where do I go next?”

Neptune always implies the next step — never demands it.

---

## 5. Color System

### Core Palette
- **Primary:** Deep Navy / Midnight Blue
- **Secondary:** Slate / Muted Blue‑Gray
- **Accent:** Soft Cyan / Aqua

### Color Rules
- No neon
- No rainbow logic
- Accent color indicates *meaning*, not decoration

If something is highlighted, it must represent:
- Active
- Next
- Successful

---

## 6. Material Language

All UI and visuals should feel manufactured from the same material family:
- Matte ceramic
- Frosted glass
- Satin polymer

### Forbidden Materials
- Chrome
- Liquid metal
- Wet or glossy biological textures

This is **product design**, not concept art.

---

## 7. UI Component Rules

### 7.1 Cards
- Rounded corners only
- Soft elevation (never harsh shadows)
- Clear internal hierarchy: title → status → action
- One primary action per card

Cards represent **stable system units**, not buttons.

---

### 7.2 Nodes (Agents, Steps, Checkpoints)
- Always circular
- Visually weighted but calm
- Color reflects state (inactive, active, complete)

Nodes should feel *trustworthy*, not interactive chaos.

---

### 7.3 Paths & Connectors
- Smooth curves only
- Consistent stroke width
- Directional flow implied subtly (never arrows unless instructional)

Paths exist to guide attention, not decorate screens.

---

### 7.4 States

#### Empty States
- Single focal element
- Calm message
- Clear next step

Empty ≠ broken. Empty = waiting with intention.

#### Loading States
- Slow, predictable motion
- No jitter, no pulse spikes

#### Success States
- Subtle accent color
- Gentle confirmation
- No confetti, no celebration noise

---

## 8. Motion Principles (When Implemented)

Motion communicates confidence.

### Motion Rules
- Slow
- Eased
- Predictable
- Never jittery

Nothing should surprise the user.

---

## 9. Dashboard Translation

### Dashboard Purpose
The dashboard is not a feature index.

It is a **guided control room**.

### Dashboard Rules
- One primary recommendation at a time
- Secondary actions visually recede
- Neptune guidance always visible but unobtrusive

The dashboard should feel like:
> “You’re already on the right track.”

---

## 10. Onboarding Translation

### Onboarding Philosophy
Onboarding is not teaching.

It is reassurance + momentum.

### Onboarding Rules
- One action per screen
- One system concept per step
- Visuals guide, text reassures

Neptune does not explain everything — it walks with the user.

---

## 11. Brand Guardrails (Hard Constraints)

### Never Allow
- Biological brains
- Dense wiring meshes
- Cyberpunk aesthetics
- Visual chaos
- Stress‑inducing motion

### Always Aim For
- Clarity
- Intentional spacing
- Guided flow
- Emotional calm

If a design feels impressive but tense, it is wrong.

---

## 12. Final North Star

GalaxyCo should feel like:

> **“This system is already thinking for me — and I can trust it.”**

That is the promise of Neptune.
That is the responsibility of the UI.

---

**This document is the foundation. All future design, UI, motion, and visual assets must align with it.**
