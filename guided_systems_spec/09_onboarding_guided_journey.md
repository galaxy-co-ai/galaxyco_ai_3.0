# GalaxyCo — Onboarding: Guided Journey

> **Purpose**  
This document defines GalaxyCo’s onboarding experience as a calm, confidence-building journey. It translates the Guided Systems philosophy into a step-by-step sequence that reassures users, builds momentum, and avoids overwhelm.

Onboarding is not teaching. It is **orientation + motion**.

---

## 1. Onboarding Philosophy

Onboarding exists to answer three questions, in order:

1. *Am I in the right place?*
2. *Is this manageable?*
3. *What should I do next?*

If onboarding attempts to explain everything, it has failed.

---

## 2. Role of Onboarding in GalaxyCo

Onboarding is the user’s **first collaboration with Neptune**.

The system should feel:
- Calm
- Capable
- Supportive

Neptune does not instruct from above. It **walks beside the user**.

---

## 3. Structural Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- One action per screen
- One system concept per step
- One primary outcome per moment

If a screen requires scrolling to understand, it is invalid.

---

## 4. Onboarding Flow Overview

### Step 1: Orientation
**Goal:** Establish trust and grounding

- Minimal copy
- Reassuring system imagery
- No required action

Emotional outcome:
> “This feels composed and intentional.”

---

### Step 2: First Meaningful Action
**Goal:** Create momentum without pressure

- Simple, low-risk action
- Immediate system response
- Clear confirmation

Emotional outcome:
> “I can do this.”

---

### Step 3: System Response
**Goal:** Demonstrate intelligence

- Neptune acknowledges the action
- Shows that the system adapted
- No technical explanation

Emotional outcome:
> “The system is paying attention.”

---

### Step 4: Gentle Expansion
**Goal:** Reveal possibility without obligation

- Optional next step
- Secondary information only
- No forced configuration

Emotional outcome:
> “There’s more here when I’m ready.”

---

## 5. Visual Language During Onboarding

- System Flow imagery preferred
- Single dominant path
- Minimal density

Visuals must guide attention, not explain architecture.

---

## 6. Copy Rules

### Tone
- Calm
- Direct
- Encouraging

### Rules
- Short sentences
- No jargon
- No hype

Example:
> “Let’s start with one simple step.”

---

## 7. Neptune’s Voice in Onboarding

Neptune should:
- Speak briefly
- Acknowledge progress
- Suggest next steps softly

Neptune must never:
- Lecture
- Interrupt
- Over-explain

Neptune feels present, not chatty.

---

## 8. Progress Indication

### Rules
- Show progress only when helpful
- Prefer steps over percentages
- Avoid countdowns or urgency

Progress should reassure, not pressure.

---

## 9. Handling Pauses & Drop-Off

If a user pauses onboarding:
- Preserve their place
- Do not punish inactivity
- Resume gently

Onboarding waits patiently.

---

## 10. Success & Completion

### Completion Signal
- Calm confirmation
- Clear transition to dashboard
- No celebration theatrics

Example:
> “You’re set up. Neptune is ready when you are.”

---

## 11. Anti-Patterns (Never Allowed)

- Long tutorials
- Feature tours
- Forced configuration
- Multi-step forms in one screen
- Explanations of AI mechanics

Curiosity should be invited, not required.

---

## 12. Validation Checklist

Before approving onboarding changes, confirm:

- Is the user always oriented?
- Is the next step obvious?
- Does it feel calm and manageable?
- Does Neptune feel supportive?

If not, remove steps.

---

## 13. Final North Star

Onboarding should always feel like:

> **“I’m not being taught a tool — I’m being welcomed into a system.”**

That is the Guided Journey.
